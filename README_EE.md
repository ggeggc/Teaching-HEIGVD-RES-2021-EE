# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2021 (en emploi)
This is the main repo for the course RES, taught at HEIG-VD in 2021. 

This is where you will find lecture notes, slides and some of the examples presented in the class. We will also keep links to the different repos used throughout the semester (for assignments).

## Upcoming deadlines

* Until Friday **March 26, at 1PM** (sharp), you must have submitted the Java IO lab. Procedure to submit your results will follow.
* Tuesday**April 13**: first written test.
  * Will take place at school.
  * Class room: ????.
  * Bring your laptop, fully equipped with wireshark, netcat, code samples and what you will have done in the next 2 lab sessions.
* Tuesday March 23 and March 30: you will work on an exercise to design, then to implement a simple application-level protocol. You will not get a grade for this lab. However, you need to do the work and to understand the content in order to have a smooth experience during the first test.

  * Get familiar with toolset and practices that will be used during the semester (maven, lombok, JUnit)
  * See a first example of a "communication" protocol 
* [Slides](./slides/00-Introduction-JER.pptx)

## Week 2

* Java IO, part 1
* [Slides part 1](./slides/01-JavaIOs-p1-JER.pdf)
* The Java IO Lab (file operations)

* Java IO, part 2
* [Slides part 2](./slides/01-JavaIOs-p2-JER.pdf)
* The Java IO Lab (file operations)

## Week 4

* Webcast for the lab: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95GwsyiSMXI (added to the RES 2021 playlist)
* TCP programming, part 1
* [Slides](./slides/02-TcpProgramming-p1-JER.pdf) and [extra slides](./slides/02-TcpProgramming-example.pdf).
* Recommended activities for the lab:
  * Start by reading the guidelines in the lab repo (https://github.com/jehrensb/Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2021-Exercise-Protocol-Design)
  * Do the exercise in a pair
  * Watch my solution (Webcast)
  * Redo the exercise (make sure that you are able to reapply the process for another protocol)
  * Read and run the TCP examples

## Week 5

* TCP programming, part 2
* [Slides](./slides/02-TcpProgramming-p2-JER.pdf) and [extra slides](./slides/02-TcpProgramming-example.pdf).
* Recommended activities for the lab:
  * Work in pairs
  * One student implements the client
  * One student implement the server
