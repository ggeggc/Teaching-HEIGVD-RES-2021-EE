# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2021 (PT)
This is the main repo for the course RES, taught at HEIG-VD in 2021. 

This is where you will find lecture notes, slides and some of the examples presented in the class. We will also keep links to the different repos used throughout the semester (for assignments).

## Upcoming deadlines

* Until Wednesday, **March 24th at 1PM** (sharp), you must have submitted the Java IO lab. For that, change the name of your PR by replacing `[WIP]` with `[TOREVIEW]`.
* Thursday **April 1st**: first written test.
  * Will take place at school.
  * RES-A students will be in room C23, RES-B students will be in room B23.
  * Bring your laptop, fully equipped with wireshark, netcat, code samples and what you will have done in the next 2 lab sessions.
* Friday March 19th and March 26th: you will work on an exercise to design, then to implement a simple application-level protocol. You will not get a grade for this lab. However, you need to do the work and to understand the content in order to have a smooth experience during the first test.
